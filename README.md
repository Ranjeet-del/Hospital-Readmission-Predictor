## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Hospital readmissions are a significant concern in healthcare, leading to increased costs and poorer patient outcomes. This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge using machine learning techniques.

The model leverages patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and hospital stay information to identify at-risk individuals, helping hospitals reduce readmission rates and improve care quality.
